A mimicry of sanguine research augmented by the complete work of their Order's transhumanist sect, it can rapidly inflict permanent changes on whoever consumes it.  It could be used to use essence more efficiently in exchange for consuming other ingredients, but its more valuable application would be for sharing the gift of dragon's blood with a companion.",
